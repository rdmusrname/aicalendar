This handover  process should be seamless, ensuring that the customer's context and history are  seamlessly transferred to the human agent avoiding repetition and frustration.

2. **Prioritizing Complex Queries:** Chatbots should  be programmed to identify and escalate  complex queries, technical issues and emotionally charged situations to human  agents. This ensures  that customers receive the  personalized attention and empathy  required to resolve their issues effectively.

3. **Maintaining the Human Touch:** Despite the efficiency of AI chatbots, customers often crave the human touch,  especially when  dealing with sensitive or highly emotional matters. Businesses must ensure that human agents are available to provide  empathy, reassurance, and personalized support  when needed.
